# Thor Optimization Notes

These notes are for AYN Thor Base/Pro/Max only. The assumed target is Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 with Adreno 740, active cooling, LPDDR5X memory, and UFS 3.1 storage per AYN's current product page. The mirrored device manual instead reports UFS 4.0, so storage generation remains unverified until checked on the physical device. Thor Lite uses Snapdragon 865 / Adreno 650 and should be treated as a separate target.

## Current Baseline

- Android builds are `arm64-v8a` only.
- Android defaults prefer Vulkan when Vulkan is enabled (`src/common/settings.h`).
- CPU JIT, hardware shaders, shader JIT, disk shader cache, async filesystem operations, and async custom texture loading are already enabled by default.
- Internal resolution defaults to 1x. Game profiles may cap or override this for stability.
- Adreno custom driver loading is already wired through `libadrenotools` and `GpuDriverHelper`.
- E.X. Troopers (`0004000000053700`) currently has a hardcoded Android launch profile and matching manifest.
- Thor dual-display mode is fixed to 3DS top screen on the primary panel and 3DS bottom screen on the secondary panel. The old hidden virtual secondary display fallback is removed, so secondary rendering only starts when Android exposes a real second display.
- The Thor GPU Driver Manager now has a guided picker. It queries K11MCH1 AdrenoToolsDrivers releases, presents the newest generic Turnip ZIP as the recommended first pick, lists recent generic Turnip rollback builds with visible download buttons, also lists Qualcomm and Turnip variant troubleshooting choices when available, validates driver metadata, stores the ZIP under `gpu_drivers`, installs immediately, and still keeps manual ZIP and system-driver fallback paths.

## 2026-08-16 Upstream and RPCS3 ARM64 Review

- Merged 37 commits from `upstream/master` (`d81195bdc` through `b34de55b5`) in merge commit `abb63f2c3`.
- Mirrored the directly relevant sibling-project research under [`research/`](research/README.md), including the chapter-by-chapter notes for Whatcookie's "PS3 emulation is fast on ARM now" video and the follow-up "what didn't make the cut" article.
- Kept the new PICA command-list lookup, batching, and four-command vectorizable path from `c688076ac`. This is directly relevant to ARM host CPU time and energy because it reduces command-dispatch overhead without changing guest semantics.
- Kept the shader output register-banking work from `74d38ddcc`, including its A64 shader-JIT changes.
- Corrected the resource-tick comparison introduced by `b34de55b5`. A sentenced surface is retained while the runtime's completed tick is equal to or older than its retirement tick and is deleted only after the completed tick advances beyond it. The upstream comparison did the opposite and could retain sentenced surfaces indefinitely.

### RPCS3 ideas deliberately not copied

- **RPCS3 timer-scaled `busy_wait`:** [RPCS3 #18055](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/18055) fixed waits that treated a low-frequency ARM generic timer like a multi-GHz x86 cycle counter. Azahar has no equivalent host-timer-calibrated busy-wait utility in its active CPU, audio, or Vulkan paths, so there is no constant to copy. Adding a second correction would repeat the kind of double-calibration regression already seen in related ARM ports.
- **ISB-based spin waiting:** Azahar has no equivalent hot emulator/render spin loop. Its Vulkan scheduler and master semaphore block on condition variables, Vulkan fences, or timeline semaphores, while Dynarmic's ARM64 lock already uses `SEVL`/`WFE`. [RPCS3 #18151](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/18151) was a small improvement over ineffective ARM `yield`, and [RPCS3 #18830](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/18830) later confirmed that hardware waits are the better primitive but did not measure an application-level power win at its first call sites.
- **Single-instruction `FMAX`/`FMIN`:** PICA's asymmetric NaN behavior differs from the PPC operation RPCS3 optimized. Azahar's A64 shader JIT intentionally uses `FCMGT` plus `BIF` to preserve PICA results.
- **SPU checksum, SHUFB, SHA3, and dot-product paths:** these target PS3 SPU/PPC workloads and have no direct 3DS guest equivalent. [RPCS3 #18056](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/18056) is still useful as a method: express the guest permutation directly with native ARM vector operations and verify final codegen. Azahar's A64 PICA shader JIT already emits native table lookup for its swizzle operation, and its A64/x64 JIT compiler method sets are currently equal at 44 methods each.
- **LLVM ARM feature attributes:** [RPCS3 #18133](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/18133) prevents LLVM from assuming that Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 exposes the Cortex-X3's disabled SVE feature. Azahar's 3DS CPU backend is Dynarmic rather than an LLVM guest recompiler and targets baseline AArch64/NEON, so it cannot reuse that patch. Azahar's existing AArch64 feature detector currently feeds host-information logging, not generated-code feature attributes; optional dot-product/i8mm paths should be added only with Android HWCAP gates and a proven hot integer kernel.
- **A dedicated Vulkan garbage-collection thread:** Azahar already has a Vulkan scheduler, presentation thread, master-semaphore completion waiter, and shader/pipeline workers. Another wake-producing thread is not justified until a Thor trace shows render-thread GC stalls; if needed, GC should first be attached to the existing completion path.
- **A global Cortex-X3 `-mcpu` setting:** Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is a mixed X3/A715/A710/A510 system, and shipping Thor hardware does not expose every optional architecture feature such as SVE/SVE2. Runtime capability gates are safer than architecture-wide compiler assumptions.

### Next Thor measurements

- Compare the pre-merge baseline and this build in the same fixed title/scene, performance mode, fan mode, brightness, renderer, resolution, and GPU driver.
- Record average FPS, 1% low or frametime distribution, battery power, battery temperature, and thermal slope over a long enough run to reach steady state.
- Use Snapdragon Profiler to check render-pass binning cost and whether dependencies or barriers break concurrent binning. Qualcomm's guidance treats memory writes/resolves and unnecessary CPU-core wakeups as power costs.
- Compare the system Vulkan driver with the current stable Turnip option using both cold and warm caches. Do not claim a driver win until visual output and stability match.

## 2026-08-16 3DS and AYN Manual Review

- Added the public Arm ARM11 MPCore DDI 0360E and ARM946E-S DDI 0201D manuals to the untracked workspace reference library. Their cache, control, WFE/WFI, and cycle-timing sections are guest correctness and instrumentation inputs; they are not host optimization recipes.
- The ARM11 manual documents parallel ALU, multiply, and load/store pipelines with forwarding and instruction-dependent interlocks. Optimize Dynarmic output from measured Snapdragon hot paths rather than trying to preserve guest pipeline structure in generated ARM64 code.
- No complete public PICA200 technical reference manual was found. The archived DMP SIGGRAPH 2007 slide is a high-level, pre-3DS description of PICA200/MAESTRO features and nominal power/throughput, not an authoritative register or shader reference.
- The AYN manual confirms a 120 Hz primary display and 60 Hz secondary display. Benchmark at fixed refresh/brightness and account for the second panel when comparing power; a frame limiter that avoids needless work above the guest rate is more useful than targeting the panel maximum.
- The AYN manual and current AYN product page disagree about UFS generation. Do not use either UFS 3.1 or UFS 4.0 bandwidth as a performance explanation until the connected Thor is queried or measured.
- Full provenance, hashes, and source links live in [`hardware/README.md`](hardware/README.md). The PDF binaries remain outside Git by explicit project policy.

## 2026-08-16 AArch64 Indexed-Draw Reduction

- `RasterizerAccelerated::AnalyzeVertexArray()` scans every indexed draw's `u8` or `u16` index buffer through `Common::FindMinMax()`. The release AArch64 binary proved that the original NEON port accumulated vector minima/maxima but then stored the vectors to the stack and expanded `std::min_element` / `std::max_element` into per-lane extracts, comparisons, conditional selects, stack traffic, and stack-protector work.
- The AArch64 path now reduces the vectors with the architecture's `vminvq_u8` / `vmaxvq_u8` and `vminvq_u16` / `vmaxvq_u16` intrinsics. The SIMD crossover is one full vector on AArch64 (16 byte indices or 8 halfword indices); x86 SSE4.2 and 32-bit NEON retain their existing two-vector crossover and fallback behavior.
- Correctness is unchanged because unsigned horizontal min/max is associative and produces the same extrema as reducing the vector lanes in scalar order. Scalar tails still process every non-vector-aligned index. The empty and scalar-only cases now also initialize their extrema explicitly instead of relying on uninitialized fallback values.
- A focused test checks every prefix length across scalar, exact-vector, multi-vector, and tail cases for both index widths against `std::minmax_element`. It passed on the AYN Thor's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 with 200 assertions in one test case.
- Binary verification on the built `libcitra-android.so` found one `uminv` and one `umaxv` in each function, with zero `umov` lane extracts and zero stack-check references. The `u8` function shrank from 904 to 284 bytes and the `u16` function from 600 to 284 bytes: 936 bytes, or 62.2%, removed from the pair.
- `:app:assembleVanillaRelWithDebInfoLite` completed successfully. The generated APK is 28,944,839 bytes with SHA-256 `CBD28CDBD3F254FA8F896AFBEF02D95EEF87F9AF55068EA121030363FCADF152`.
- ADB now enumerates the Thor over USB as `c3ca0370` and over Wi-Fi as `192.168.1.33:5555`; USB is the deterministic deployment target. The focused correctness test passes on device, but power/FPS claims remain pending. Compare a fixed indexed-draw-heavy scene with identical title, cache state, renderer, resolution, driver, display layout, performance/fan mode, and brightness, then record FPS, frametime distribution, battery power, temperature, and thermal slope.

## 2026-08-16 AArch64 HLE Audio Downmix

- The 3DS HLE audio final mixer downmixes three 160-sample quadraphonic buses into stereo or mono every DSP frame. The original 2016 generic loop remained scalar in the release AArch64 object even though the larger per-source mixer loop auto-vectorizes successfully.
- The AArch64 path now processes four frames at a time with NEON structure loads/stores, vector integer-to-float conversion, the same multiply/FMA order as the old AArch64 code, truncating float-to-integer conversion, saturating `s32`-to-`s16` narrowing, and saturating accumulation into the current stereo frame. Mono, stereo, and the existing surround-as-stereo fallback all retain their prior behavior; non-AArch64 builds retain the scalar implementation.
- A focused end-to-end mixer test feeds all three buses with lane-varying values that cross both saturation limits and compares mono, stereo, and surround output with the scalar reference. It passed on the AYN Thor with three assertions covering mono, stereo, and surround.
- Exact release codegen changed from one-sample scalar loops to four-sample NEON loops. The stereo body fell from 39 instructions per sample to 20 instructions per four samples (5 per sample), while the mono body fell from 35 instructions per sample to 19 instructions per four samples (4.75 per sample). The containing function shrank from 436 to 280 bytes, a 156-byte or 35.8% reduction.
- The complete `:app:assembleVanillaRelWithDebInfoLite` build passed in 5m33s. The APK is 28,945,479 bytes with SHA-256 `34549C9F41FB5B6D773E40DC8DBD26E9B22D5DA210453915F1358873E2A067B2`.
- The same machine-code audit rejected several tempting false positives: Crypto++ already compiles Rijndael with `-march=armv8-a+crypto`; SoundTouch ships in 16-bit integer mode and its correlation loop already auto-vectorizes to NEON; and the per-source 24-channel HLE mixer already becomes an eight-frame NEON loop. Crypto acceleration can improve encrypted content and service latency, but it is not currently evidence of a sustained FPS or wattage win.

## 2026-08-16 AArch64 PICA Tile Codec

- `MortonCopyTile()` sits in every rasterizer-cache texture upload and download. Exact release AArch64 codegen proved that a full 8x8 RGBA8 tile was still expanded into 64 scalar loads, 64 scalar stores, and, for Vulkan's required RGBA conversion, 64 scalar byte reversals.
- The AArch64 path now maps the PICA 2x2/4x4/8x8 Morton structure directly onto NEON structured loads and stores. RGBA8 upload uses eight `LD2` operations to deinterleave pairs of rows, sixteen vector `REV32` operations when Vulkan needs component reversal, and eight paired 256-bit row stores. That replaces 192 scalar load/reverse/store operations with 32 vector memory/shuffle operations per full converted tile, an 83.3% reduction in those core operations. The reverse download path uses the corresponding `ST2` interleave. Native RGB5A1, RGB565, RGBA4, and D16 tiles use the same approach at 16 bits per pixel.
- The always-expanded PICA texture formats were a second scalar gap. IA8, RG8, I8, A8, and IA4 now combine Morton deinterleave with NEON `ST4` RGBA expansion during uploads instead of processing and storing one pixel at a time. For I8, the old exact AArch64 tile function ran a 53-instruction row body eight times; the ThinLTO full-tile vector body is 54 instructions total, an 87.3% reduction in that hot body. IA4 performs both nibble replications in vector lanes.
- The optimization is gated to AArch64 and only to formats whose old behavior can be represented exactly: RGBA8 with or without its existing whole-pixel byte reversal, non-converted raw 16-bit formats, and the five upload-only expansion formats above. RGB8/D24 packing, D24S8 rotation, ETC decoding, I4/A4 unpacking, and expanded-format downloads stay on their existing scalar paths.
- A focused test covers both Morton-to-linear upload and linear-to-Morton download, a deliberately padded ten-pixel stride, native and converted RGBA8, all three native 16-bit color formats, D16, and exact IA8/RG8/I8/A8/IA4 expansion. It compares against byte-wise scalar Morton references and verifies exact raw-format round trips. It passed on the AYN Thor with 17 assertions in one test case.
- The latest `:app:assembleVanillaRelWithDebInfoLite` passed in 2m16s. ThinLTO preserved the intended `LD2`, `UZP`, vector `REV32`, `ST2`, paired-store, and `ST4` sequences in `libcitra-android.so`. The APK is 28,945,287 bytes with SHA-256 `4B8A57E3ECD8754389F6CA568E53BF463F1C0888D94B40BDB001ACA52B8B17B6`.
- This is a static work and instruction-count win, not yet a claimed FPS or wattage result. Texture-cache effectiveness makes the on-device impact title- and scene-dependent; the matched Thor A/B must include texture-streaming scenes and render-target readbacks as well as steady-state gameplay.
- The verified APK installed successfully as `org.azahar_emu.azahar.debug`, launched into `MainActivity`, and remained running. Temporary stripped test runners were deleted from both the PC temp directory and `/data/local/tmp` after the checks.

## 2026-08-16 Vulkan Anime4K Repair

- The old Vulkan path did not implement Anime4K. It bound one surface as all three shader inputs and ran only the final refine shader while rendering back into that same image. That omitted both gradient passes and created an invalid sample/render feedback dependency.
- Vulkan now copies the requested unscaled source rectangle to an independent image, renders the X gradient to RG16F at 2x, renders the Y/luma gradient to R16F at 2x, and uses those results for the final refine pass into the scaled surface. The passes use independent framebuffers, cached format-compatible pipelines, clamp-to-edge samplers, and explicit `GENERAL`-layout dependencies between transfer writes, color writes, fragment reads, and the final surface use.
- `:app:buildCMakeRelWithDebInfo[arm64-v8a]` and `:app:assembleVanillaRelWithDebInfoLite` both passed. The resulting APK installed on the AYN Thor and loaded 7TH DRAGON III CODE: VFD at 3x resolution with Vulkan, Turnip Adreno 740, and Anime4K explicitly reported in the native configuration log.
- A fixed title-screen capture rendered at 30 FPS with no fatal, pipeline-creation, Vulkan, or shader error. Its expected Anime4K edge refinement matched a control capture from the existing OpenGL Anime4K path; screenshots and device logs were test artifacts and are not committed.
- This restores correctness, not efficiency. Anime4K performs three full-screen texture passes plus a source copy for each filtered upload and keeps intermediate images by source size/format for safe reuse across queued Vulkan work. It is labeled very heavy in the Android UI. None or Bicubic remains the better Thor choice when lower GPU load, memory use, and battery power matter more than aggressive anime-line refinement.

## 2026-08-16 Anime4K v4 Mobile Screen Filter

- Android Graphics settings now has a separate **Screen Filter** selector beside Linear Filtering.
  It is distinct from **Texture Filter**: the old filter changes individual emulated textures before
  games use them, while the new mode filters each finished 3DS screen as it is scaled into the
  final layout. The default is None, so existing output and GPU cost do not change unless selected.
- **Anime4K v4 Mobile** is derived from the MIT-licensed non-CNN DoG upscaler shipped in the
  official [Anime4K v4.0.1 release](https://github.com/bloc97/Anime4K/tree/v4.0.1/glsl/Upscale).
  The desktop-oriented implementation uses luma, horizontal Gaussian, vertical Gaussian, and
  apply passes. This Thor port fuses the DoG idea into one presentation pass with a normalized 3x3
  Gaussian, the same 0.8 luma correction strength, and a local luma min/max clamp. It samples nine
  source texels per output fragment but creates no intermediate image and performs no extra
  full-frame read/write pass, reducing mobile tile-memory bandwidth at the cost of not being a
  pixel-identical port of the full separable filter or its multi-pass CNN alternatives.
- The shader activates only when both output axes exceed the input by 1.2x, matching Anime4K's
  upscale-only intent. It preserves source alpha, clamps corrected RGB, forces the required linear
  sampler only while the screen filter is active, and leaves normal nearest/linear presentation
  alone at native size or while downscaling. Anaglyph and interlaced 3D retain their existing
  two-eye shaders and the user's ordinary presentation sampler.
- Vulkan has a dedicated fourth presentation pipeline and supports both dynamic descriptor-array
  indexing and the existing switch fallback. OpenGL has a matching built-in presentation shader.
  The setting is persisted through Android and desktop configuration and is logged by name.
- NDK `glslc` accepted both Vulkan indexing variants and the OpenGL fragment shader. The complete
  ARM64 `:app:assembleVanillaRelWithDebInfoLite` build passed; the APK is 28,961,939 bytes with
  SHA-256 `4C7979B6A8AB5A6A725AF9EE07536A7D5172BB809286112E093F51F8EA58E543`.
- Per the active no-launch restriction, the APK was not installed or run. Visual quality, Adreno
  frametime, and power remain unmeasured. The required A/B is None versus Anime4K v4 Mobile in the
  same anime-heavy title and fixed scene, with identical renderer, internal resolution, layout,
  driver, brightness, fan/performance mode, cache state, and duration; record frame distribution,
  KGSL busy time, battery power, temperature, and thermal slope before changing recommendations.

## 2026-08-16 Dynarmic A32 ARM64 FastDispatch

- The ARM64 A32 backend previously sent every `FastDispatchHint` terminal back through
  the C++ dispatcher even though the x64 backend had a native two-tier dispatch cache.
  ARM64 now checks a 65,536-entry direct-mapped table in generated AArch64 code and calls
  `GetOrEmit()` only on a descriptor miss. Return-stack-buffer misses use the same fast
  path when the optimization is enabled.
- The descriptor is loaded directly from the adjacent A32 PC and upper-descriptor state,
  and the emitted hash exactly matches the C++ invalidation hash. Range invalidation
  clears a matching entry; full cache clears discard the table and block-range map at the
  same explicit virtual cache-clear boundary. Single-step mode retains the slow dispatcher.
- Two focused cache tests warm a FastDispatch entry, mutate guest code, and verify that
  range invalidation and full-cache clearing cannot execute stale host code. The release
  ARM64 test binary passed all 11 assertions on the AYN Thor.
- A hidden benchmark alternates between two dynamically selected ARM blocks so constant
  propagation and ordinary block linking cannot bypass dispatch. Every other Dynarmic
  optimization is identical between the baseline and candidate. Each long sample performs
  one million indirect dispatches and the process is pinned to Thor CPU7.
- The reverse-order long run measured the C++ dispatcher at 4.014-4.016 ms per million
  dispatches and stable ARM64 FastDispatch at 2.128 ms: 1.89x dispatch throughput and
  47.0% less time in this dispatcher-saturated workload. Across shorter pinned/unpinned
  runs and both orderings, measured throughput ranged from 1.69x to 1.95x.
- This is not a claim of 1.89x game FPS. Game impact scales with the share of CPU time spent
  on unpredictable block dispatch; GPU-bound scenes may show no FPS change. The benchmark
  was too short for a useful battery-power comparison, so lower watts remains unproven until
  matched sustained game-scene A/B runs.
- Dynarmic and its recursive build dependencies are now vendored in this repository from
  upstream commit `e77b1ba0b7da7cbe93021b01a663acfe7c4dd516`; provenance and update rules
  are in [`research/dynarmic-vendor.md`](research/dynarmic-vendor.md).
- The final `:app:assembleVanillaRelWithDebInfoLite` build passed. The APK is 28,953,903
  bytes with SHA-256 `F85766DB96E8F820BF5C6FE945714CFA111A36082CE4B2A9028B5C41D6AD2B89`.
  It installed on the Thor and booted 7TH DRAGON III CODE: VFD through the vendored JIT
  with Vulkan, Turnip Adreno 740, and Anime4K; the launch log had no fatal signal,
  exception, or native abort.

## 2026-08-16 Android Eco Turbo

- Android fast-forward previously allowed every emulated VBlank to prepare and submit a host
  presentation. On the Thor's 120 Hz primary panel, high turbo limits can therefore run layout,
  composition, and presentation work well above the normal 3DS refresh rate even though the user
  is primarily asking the game to advance faster.
- The new General setting **Eco Turbo** defaults on. Whenever the active frame limit is above 100%,
  it caps only host presentation/composition to 60 FPS. Guest CPU execution, PICA work, audio,
  timing, and the requested turbo limit continue unchanged. Both Vulkan and OpenGL skip the
  surplus host frames; screenshots and video dumping still prepare their required framebuffers.
- The limiter uses elapsed wall time and a one-frame token budget rather than dividing by the
  requested turbo percentage. This matters when a heavy scene requests 400% but achieves less than
  100%: frames at or below 60 FPS are still all presented. Returning to normal speed or disabling
  Eco Turbo resets the budget immediately.
- The final release APK was tested on 7TH DRAGON III CODE: VFD (`000400000018F800`) at 3x,
  Vulkan, Turnip Mesa 25.99.99, Anime4K, duplicate-frame skipping enabled, and a temporary 400%
  frame limit. The title screen sustained 120 game FPS and 399-403% speed in the overlay with Eco
  both off and on.
- In the reversed-order final-code 20-second A/B, Eco off measured 32.45% KGSL GPU busy and 444
  process CPU ticks. Eco on measured 26.81% GPU busy and 409 ticks: **17.37% less GPU active time**
  and **7.9% less process CPU time** while emulation speed was retained. Both runs held the same
  615 MHz GPU frequency and 24.0 C battery temperature.
- This is not a 17.37% battery-watt claim. The device reported USB power and active charging during
  the run, so battery-current telemetry could not isolate emulator power. A long, unplugged,
  fixed-brightness/fan/performance-mode A/B is still required for watts and thermal slope.
- Benefit depends on workload. At 200% this title submits 60 game frames per second, so the existing
  duplicate-frame setting already removes surplus presentation and Eco Turbo has little extra work
  to skip. The win is larger when a title/turbo combination produces more than 60 unique frames per
  second. Disabling Eco Turbo remains available for maximum fast-forward smoothness on 120 Hz.
- `:app:assembleVanillaRelWithDebInfoLite` passed, producing a 28,957,711-byte APK with SHA-256
  `67CE6DB9E4D153899B84C54249C76E8FB009D2840FE3D4BEB849C9CD8338FF53`.
  It installed on the Thor, restored the user's original config after testing, and booted the same
  game at the original 100% limit with Eco Turbo defaulting on and no fatal exception or signal.

## 2026-08-16 Dynarmic A32 ARM64 Absolute-Offset Page Table

- Every ordinary mapped A32 guest load/store uses Dynarmic's inline page-table lookup. The old
  ARM64 sequence loaded the host page pointer and then emitted `AND guest_address, 0xfff` into a
  second scratch register before the host access. Dynarmic already supports an absolute-offset
  table whose entry is `host_page_pointer - guest_page_base`; adding the full guest address then
  reaches the same host byte and removes that `AND` plus its scratch-register dependency.
- The implementation does not allocate a duplicate page table. The existing 1,048,576-entry raw
  table stores adjusted entries on AArch64, while its C++ wrapper decodes them before any normal
  memory-system caller sees a pointer. Mapping, unmapping, rasterizer-cache transitions,
  watchpoints, and savestate reconstruction already route through that wrapper or the shared
  rebuild helper. Non-AArch64 hosts retain ordinary host pointers and Dynarmic's original mode.
- Correctness relies only on unsigned `uintptr_t` arithmetic, so encoding and decoding are exact
  modulo the host address width. Null mappings remain null. An always-on assertion rejects the one
  value Dynarmic cannot represent in this mode: a valid host page whose adjusted entry is null.
  A focused test checks the C++ pointer round trip, the exact Dynarmic entry equation, and unmapping.
- `:app:buildCMakeRelWithDebInfo[arm64-v8a]` passed in 3m50s, including compilation and linking of
  the ARM64 test executable and `libcitra-android.so`. Per the active no-launch restriction, the app
  and ARM64 test executable were not run on the Thor.
- This is a generated-instruction reduction, not yet a game FPS or battery-watt result. It affects
  mapped page-table loads/stores; the page-index extraction, entry load, null check, and callback
  fallback remain. The required Thor A/B is the same fixed title/scene, caches, Vulkan driver,
  resolution, layout, brightness, fan/performance mode, and run duration, recording FPS,
  frametimes, process CPU time, battery power, temperature, and thermal slope.

## High-Value Optimization Places

1. Data-driven Thor game profiles

   `ApplyAndroidGameProfile()` currently hardcodes E.X. Troopers. Move this toward a small data-driven loader or generated map from `src/android/app/src/main/assets/game_profiles/*.ini` so per-title settings can be added without expanding native `if` blocks.

   Useful profile knobs: resolution cap, custom texture disable/preload disable, shader settings, frame limit, GPU timing simulation, render-thread delay, and title-specific compatibility hacks.

2. Adreno 740 Vulkan driver testing

   The fork can now fetch and install recent generic Turnip builds, Turnip variants, and a Qualcomm fallback, but this is not the same as a fully tested Thor driver matrix. Keep tracking which package works best for 3DS workloads on Thor Base/Pro/Max, and avoid silently forcing a driver without user action.

3. Shader stutter testing

   `async_shader_compilation` defaults to off. On Adreno 740/Vulkan it is worth A/B testing per title, especially for games with shader compilation hitching. Do not flip it globally until visual correctness is checked.

4. Resolution and texture guardrails

   The Thor 8 Gen 2 can handle more than native resolution in many titles, but 3x+ can still be a bad default for heavy games or dual-screen presentation. Keep default 1x, cap problem titles at 2x, and avoid preload/custom textures unless a title is proven stable.

5. Compatibility-cost toggles

   `simulate_3ds_gpu_timings` improves correctness but can cost performance in some games. `delay_game_render_thread_us` is available for dynamic-framerate edge cases. These should be per-title profile toggles, not global Thor defaults.

## Benchmark Checklist

- Test with the release-style Thor APK: `:app:assembleVanillaRelWithDebInfoLite`.
- Use the same Thor Control Center performance mode, fan mode, brightness, and driver before comparing.
- Capture FPS, frametime stability, speed percentage, battery temperature, and whether audio crackles.
- Run one cold-cache pass and one warm-cache pass.
- Record the title ID, region, ROM revision, cheat preset, renderer, internal resolution, secondary display layout, and GPU driver.
